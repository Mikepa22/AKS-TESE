# App deployment using docker and AKS
I created a cluster composed of 2 nodes
2 applications were deployed, The first one classifies images using a ResNet20 model. The second one is a simple webpage that shows my CV
The applications were created using docker containers which were uploaded to Docker Hub and referenced in the .yaml file
